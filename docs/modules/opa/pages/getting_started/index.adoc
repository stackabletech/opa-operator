= Getting started

This guide will get you started with the OpenPolicyAgent (OPA) using the Stackable operator.
It will guide you through the installation of the operator, setting up your first OPA instance, creating a policy rule and querying it.

== Prerequisites

You will need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* curl
* optional: Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== What's next

The Guide is divided into two steps:

* xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[Installing the operator].
* xref:getting_started/first_steps.adoc[Setting up an OPA, a policy rule and querying it].
