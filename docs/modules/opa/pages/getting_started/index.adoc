:description: Get started with OPA using Stackable Operator. Install, set up OPA, create a policy rule, and query it in Kubernetes.

This guide gets you started with the OpenPolicyAgent (OPA) using the Stackable operator.
It guides you through the installation of the operator, setting up your first OPA instance, creating a policy rule and querying it.

== Prerequisites

You need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* curl
* optional: Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point a minimum of the following resources is recommended for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== What's next

The Guide is divided into two steps:
