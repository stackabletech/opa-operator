:description: The managed OPA instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics.

The managed OPA instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics.
See xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

You can read the list of exported metrics in the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/monitoring#prometheus[OPA monitoring documentation].

Especially worth mentioning are the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/monitoring#status-metrics[Status metrics], which contain e.g. `opa_info`, `bundle_loaded_counter` and `bundle_failed_load_counter`.
You can use these to create a dashboard to see any bundle loading problems at a glance.
You can also set up alerts to get notified proactively.
