= Log aggregation

The logs can be forwarded to a Vector log aggregator by providing a discovery
ConfigMap for the aggregator and by enabling the log agent:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
  servers:
    config:
      logging:
        enableVectorAgent: true
        containers:
          opa:
            console:
              level: NONE
            file:
              level: INFO
----

The Stackable operator for OPA only supports automatic log configuration due to the lack of customization for the OPA logging.

Furthermore, the only customization possible for console output for the `opa` and `bundle-builder` containers is `NONE`. This deactivates console logging. Other log levels for console logging in these containers will be overwritten by the file log level.

Further information on how to configure logging, can be found in
xref:home:concepts:logging.adoc[].
