= Defining policies
:rego-docs: https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/

You can define policies by using Rego, OPAs {rego-docs}[policy language].

Policy definitions are deployed as ConfigMap resources as described in xref:implementation-notes.adoc[implementation notes].

Here is an example:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test
  labels:
    opa.stackable.tech/bundle: "true" # <1>
data:
  test.rego: | # <2>
    package test

    hello {
      true
    }

    world {
      false
    }
----
<1> Mark this `ConfigMap` as a bundle source.
<2> `test.rego` is the file name to use inside the bundle for these rules.
