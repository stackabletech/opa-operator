= User info fetcher
:description: User Info Fetcher for OPA retrieves data from backends like Keycloak. Integrate extra user details into Rego rules for enhanced policy management.

The _User info fetcher_ allows for additional information to be obtained from the configured backend (for example, Keycloak).
You can then write Rego rules for OpenPolicyAgent which make an HTTP request to the User info fetcher and make use of the additional information returned for the username or user id.

You can enable the User info fetcher sidecar as follows:

<1> Enable the `user-info-fetcher` sidecar
<2> Enable TLS verification using the CA from the `tls` SecretClass.
<3> Obtain Keycloak API credentials from the specified secret. The Secret must have `clientId` and `clientSecret` entries.
<4> Refer to the applicable realm in your Keycloak server.

Currently the following backends are supported:

* xref:#backend-keycloak[]
* xref:#backend-activedirectory[]
* xref:#backend-entra[]
* xref:#backend-openldap[]

[#backends]
== Backends

The user info fetcher can fetch data from a few different backends. We currently recommend the xref:#backend-keycloak[] backend.

[#backend-keycloak]
=== Keycloak

// todo: maybe this section should be under a Tutorial?
Fetch groups and extra credentials, but not roles.

NOTE: The OAuth2 Client in Keycloak must be given the `view-users` _Service Account Role_ for the realm that the users are in.

The user-info-fetcher requires a service account in Keycloak with the permissions to read user objects.
To create such as user you need to take the following steps:

*With your user realm selected* click on `Clients` at the left side and use the `Import client` button:

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/1.png[]

Create a file with the following JSON object.
Swap out `secret` with your desired password and potentially `redirectUris` and `webOrigins`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "clientId" : "user-info-fetcher",
  "surrogateAuthRequired" : false,
  "enabled" : true,
  "alwaysDisplayInConsole" : false,
  "clientAuthenticatorType" : "client-secret",
  "secret" : "XXX",
  "redirectUris" : [ "*" ],
  "webOrigins" : [ "*" ],
  "notBefore" : 0,
  "bearerOnly" : false,
  "serviceAccountsEnabled" : true,
  "publicClient" : false,
  "frontchannelLogout" : true,
  "protocol" : "openid-connect",
  "attributes" : {
    "oidc.ciba.grant.enabled" : "true",
    "oauth2.device.authorization.grant.enabled" : "false"
  },
  "authenticationFlowBindingOverrides" : { },
  "fullScopeAllowed" : true
}
----

Upload the file to the client importer and click on `Save`.

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/2.png[]

Afterwards you need to modify the created user `service-account-user-info-fetcher`.
To achieve this open the user and click on the `Role mapping tab`:

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/3.png[]

Assign the role `view-users` as shown below.
This is necessary to allow the user to read other users' information.

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/4.png[]

Afterwards you can store the user-info-fetcher credentials in Kubernetes in a Secret:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: user-info-fetcher-client-credentials
stringData:
  clientId: user-info-fetcher
  clientSecret: XXX # replace with your chosen password
----

[#backend-activedirectory]
=== Active Directory

WARNING: The Active Directory backend is experimental, and subject to change.

Fetches user attributes and groups over LDAP.

For this to work user-info-fetcher needs to be provided with a Kerberos keytab that enables it to access Active Directory.
This is provided by a configurable SecretClass.
[source,yaml]
----

<7> The name of the SecretClass that knows how to create Kerberos keytabs trusted by Active Directory
<8> The name of the SecretClass that contains the Active Directory's root CA certificate(s)


When retrieving user groups from Active Directory, the user info fetcher filters by both `upn` as well as `sAmAccountName` using the following query:

[source]
----
(&(objectClass=user)(|(userPrincipalName=<upn>@<realm>)(userPrincipalName=<upn>)(sAMAccountName=<upn>)))
----

where `<upn>` is the user principal name of the user and `<realm>` is the realm of the user.

The above is to accommodate for different Active Directory user management strategies and is subject to change in future releases.

[#backend-entra]
=== Entra

NOTE: The Entra backend was marked as non-experimental in SDP 26.3.0.

Fetch groups but not roles for a user from Entra.

NOTE: The client in Entra must use the `client_credentials` flow and requires the `User.ReadAll` and `GroupMemberShip.ReadAll` permissions.

----
<1> Enables the Entra backend
<2> The Entra tenant ID
<3> A secret containing the `clientId` and `clientSecret` keys

[#backend-openldap]
=== OpenLDAP

WARNING: The OpenLDAP backend is experimental, and subject to change.

Fetch user attributes and groups over LDAP from OpenLDAP servers using simple bind authentication.

OpenLDAP supports different group schemas:

* *groupOfNames* (default): Groups contain a `member` attribute with full user DNs
* *posixGroup*: Groups contain a `memberUid` attribute with usernames

----
<1> Enables the OpenLDAP backend
<2> The hostname of the LDAP server
<3> The port of the LDAP server. Defaults to `636` for LDAPS, or `389` for plain LDAP
<4> The base distinguished name to search. Users outside of this will not be seen
<5> Configuration for LDAP bind credentials
<6> The name of the SecretClass that provides the bind credentials. The secret must contain `user` and `password` keys
<7> LDAP attribute used for the user's unique identifier. Defaults to `entryUUID`
<8> LDAP attribute used for the username. Defaults to `uid`
<9> LDAP search base for groups. If not specified, uses the main `searchBase`
<10> LDAP attribute on group objects that contains member references. Use `member` for `groupOfNames` (default) or `memberUid` for `posixGroup`
<11> Arbitrary LDAP attributes can be requested to be fetched and returned in the user info response. Use this to map custom LDAP attributes to custom attribute names in the response
<12> Optional TLS configuration for secure LDAP connections
<13> The name of the SecretClass that contains the LDAP server's root CA certificate(s)

When retrieving user information from OpenLDAP, the user info fetcher first searches for the user by the `userNameAttribute` (defaults to `uid`) or `userIdAttribute` (defaults to `entryUUID`) depending on the request type. When a user is found, it searches for groups containing the user:

* If `groupMemberAttribute` is `memberUid`: Searches for groups where `memberUid` equals the username (for `posixGroup`)
* Otherwise (e.g. if `groupMemberAttribute` is `member`, which is the default): Searches for groups where `member` equals the user's full DN (for `groupOfNames`)

== User info fetcher API

User information can be retrieved from regorules using the functions `userInfoByUsername(username)` and `userInfoById(id)` in `data.stackable.opa.userinfo.v1`.

An example of the returned structure:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "af07f12c-a2db-40a7-93e0-874537bdf3f5",
  "username": "alice",
  "groups": [
    "/admin"
  ],
  "customAttributes": {}
}
----

NOTE: The exact formats of `id` and `groups` will vary depending on the xref:#backends[backend] in use. This example is using the xref:#backend-keycloak[] backend.

=== Debug request

To debug the user-info-fetcher you can `curl` it's API for a given user.
To achieve this shell into the `opa` container and execute

[source,bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"my-user"}' http://127.0.0.1:9476/user
----

You can also use `-d '{"id":"123456"}'` to query by the user ID.

=== Rego rule library

The HTTP API exposed by the user-info-fetcher can be called directly using the rego function `http.send`.
However, we provide a convenience rego rule library, which we ship with `OpaClusters` by default.

For example, the following rule allows access for users in the `/admin` group:

[source,rego]
----
package test

default allow := false

allow if {
    user := data.stackable.opa.userinfo.v1.userInfoById(input.userId)
    "/admin" in user.groups
}
----
