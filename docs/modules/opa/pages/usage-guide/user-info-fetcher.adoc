= User info fetcher
:description: Experimental User Info Fetcher for OPA retrieves data from backends like Keycloak. Integrate extra user details into Rego rules for enhanced policy management.

WARNING: This feature is experimental, and subject to change.

The _User info fetcher_ allows for additional information to be obtained from the configured backend (for example, Keycloak).
You can then write Rego rules for OpenPolicyAgent which make an HTTP request to the User info fetcher and make use of the additional information returned for the username or user id.

You can enable the User info fetcher sidecar as follows:

[source,yaml]

----

<1> Enable the `user-info-fetcher` sidecar
<2> Enable TLS verification using the CA from the `tls` SecretClass.
<3> Obtain Keycloak API credentials from the specified secret. The Secret must have `clientId` and `clientSecret` entries.
<4> Refer to the applicable realm in your Keycloak server.

Currently the following backends are supported:

* xref:#backend-keycloak[]
* xref:#backend-activedirectory[]
* xref:#backend-entra[]

[#backends]
== Backends

The user info fetcher can fetch data from a few different backends. We currently recommend the xref:#backend-keycloak[] backend.

[#backend-keycloak]
=== Keycloak

// todo: maybe this section should be under a Tutorial?
Fetch groups and extra credentials, but not roles.

NOTE: The OAuth2 Client in Keycloak must be given the `view-users` _Service Account Role_ for the realm that the users are in.

user-info-fetcher needs a service account at Keycloak with the permissions to read user objects.
To create such as user you need to take the following steps:

*With your user realm selected* click on `Clients` at the left side and use the `Import client` button:

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/1.png[]

Create a file with the following JSON objects.
Swap out `secret` with your desired password and potentially `redirectUris` and `webOrigins`.

[source,json]
----
{
  "clientId" : "user-info-fetcher",
  "surrogateAuthRequired" : false,
  "enabled" : true,
  "alwaysDisplayInConsole" : false,
  "clientAuthenticatorType" : "client-secret",
  "secret" : "XXX",
  "redirectUris" : [ "*" ],
  "webOrigins" : [ "*" ],
  "notBefore" : 0,
  "bearerOnly" : false,
  "serviceAccountsEnabled" : true,
  "publicClient" : false,
  "frontchannelLogout" : true,
  "protocol" : "openid-connect",
  "attributes" : {
    "oidc.ciba.grant.enabled" : "true",
    "oauth2.device.authorization.grant.enabled" : "false"
  },
  "authenticationFlowBindingOverrides" : { },
  "fullScopeAllowed" : true
}
----

Upload the file to the client importer and click on `Save`.

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/2.png[]

Afterwards you need to modify the created user `service-account-user-info-fetcher`.
To achieve this open the user and click on the `Role mapping tab`:

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/3.png[]

Assign the role `view-users` as shown below.
This is needed, so that the user is allowed to read other users information.

image::keycloak-user-info-fetcher/4.png[]

Afterwards you can store the user-info-fetcher credentials in Kubernetes with something like

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: user-info-fetcher-client-credentials
stringData:
  clientId: user-info-fetcher
  clientSecret: XXX # replace with your chosen password
----

[#backend-activedirectory]
=== Active Directory

WARNING: The Active Directory backend is experimental, and subject to change.

Fetches user attributes and groups over LDAP.

For this to work user-info-fetcher needs to be provided with a Kerberos keytab that enables it to access Active Directory.
This is provided by a configurable SecretClass.
[source,yaml]

[#backend-entra]
=== Entra

WARNING: The Entra backend is experimental, and subject to change.

Fetch groups but not roles for a user from Entra.

NOTE: The client in Entra must use the `client_credentials` flow and requires the `User.ReadAll` and `GroupMemberShip.ReadAll` permissions.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    userInfo:

== User info fetcher API

User information can be retrieved from regorules using the functions `userInfoByUsername(username)` and `userInfoById(id)` in `data.stackable.opa.userinfo.v1`.

An example of the returned structure:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "af07f12c-a2db-40a7-93e0-874537bdf3f5",
  "username": "alice",
  "groups": [
    "/admin"
  ],
  "customAttributes": {}
}
----

NOTE: The exact formats of `id` and `groups` will vary depending on the xref:#backends[backend] in use. This example is using the xref:#backend-keycloak[] backend.

=== Debug request

To debug the user-info-fetcher you can `curl` it's API for a given user.
To achieve this shell into the `user-info-fetcher` container and execute

[source,bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"my-user"}' http://127.0.0.1:9476/user
----

You can also use `-d '{"id":"123456"}'` to query by the user ID.

=== Rego rule library

You could call the HTTP API from rego rules yourself.
However, we provide a convenience rego rule library, which we ship with `OpaClusters` by default.

For example, the following rule allows access for users in the `/admin` group:

[source,rego]
----
package test

default allow := false

allow if {
    user := data.stackable.opa.userinfo.v1.userInfoById(input.userId)
    "/admin" in user.groups
}
----
