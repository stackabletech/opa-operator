= Resource requests

include::concepts:stackable_resource_requests.adoc[]

A minimal OPA setup consists of 1 Pod per Node (DaemonSet) and has the following https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[resource requirements] per scheduled Pod:

* `600m` CPU request
* `1200m` CPU limit
* `512Mi` memory request and limit

Of course, additional services, require additional resources.
For Stackable components, see the corresponding documentation on further resource requirements.

Corresponding to the values above, the operator uses the following resource defaults for the main app container:

[source,yaml]
----
servers:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          cpu:
            min: 250m
            max: 500m
          memory:
            limit: 256Mi
----

WARNING: The default values are _most likely_ not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production.
Please adapt according to your requirements.
