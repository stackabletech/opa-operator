= Service exposition with ListenerClasses

OPA offers an API.
The operator deploys a Service called `<name>` (where `<name>` is the name of the OpaCluster) through which OPA can be reached.

This service can have three different types: `cluster-internal`, `external-unstable` and `external-stable`.
Read more about the types in the xref:concepts:service-exposition.adoc[service exposition] documentation at platform level.

This is how the ListenerClass is configured:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: cluster-internal  # <1>
----
<1> The default `cluster-internal` setting.
