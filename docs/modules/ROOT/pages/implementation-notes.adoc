= Implementation Notes

These notes may be of use when trying to understand why things are implemented the way that they are,
but should not be required reading for regular use.

== OPA replica per Node

We run an OPA on each node, because we want to avoid requiring network round trips for services making
policy queries (which are often chained in serial, and block other tasks in the products).

== OPA Bundle Builder

Each OPA pod runs a container that watches for `ConfigMap` objects labeled `opa.stackable.tech/bundle`.
All `ConfigMap`s are bundled together in a single `bundle.tar.gz` file that is served to the colocated OPA container.
